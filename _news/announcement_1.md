## Overview

CCPC (China Collegiate Programming Contest) Final 2020 is hosted by Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications on May 30, 2021. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, CCPC Final 2020, which was supposed to be held last year, was postponed to this year, so it is CCPC Final **2020** instead of 2021.
