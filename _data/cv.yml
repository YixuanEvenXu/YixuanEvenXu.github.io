    - title: Learning Coalition Structures with Games
      year: 2024
      description:
        - To appear at <b>AAAI 2024</b>.
        - Authors&#58 <b>Yixuan Even Xu</b>, Chun Kai Ling, Fei Fang.
        - We propose and study the Coalition Structure Learning  problem under one-bit observation and present a novel Iterative Grouping (IG) algorithm to efficiently tackle it, achieving a sample complexity asymptotically matching lower bounds.

    - title: Non-Excludable Bilateral Trade Between Groups
      year: 2024
      description:
        - To appear at <b>AAAI 2024</b>.
        - Authors&#58 <b>Yixuan Even Xu</b>, Hanrui Zhang, Vincent Conitzer.
        - We generalize the traditional bilateral trade problem to a non-excludable setting, where we characterize feasible mechanisms, give a mechanism with all desiderata in some cases, and prove hardness results for others.

    - title: A One-Size-Fits-All Approach to Improving Randomness in Paper Assignment
      year: 2023
      description:
        - To appear as a <b>Spotlight</b> at <b>NeurIPS 2023</b>.
        - Authors&#58 <b>Yixuan Even Xu</b>, Steven Jecmen, Zimeng Song, Fei Fang.
        - We identify the importance of randomness in paper assignment and formally formulate the problem, where we propose an algorithm that theoretically and empirically outperforms the currently deployed algorithm for randomized assignment.

    - title: On the Perturbation Function of Ranking and Balance for Weighted Online Bipartite Matching
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Published at <b>ESA 2023</b>.
        - Authors&#58 Jingxun Liang*, Zhihao Gavin Tang*, <b>Yixuan Even Xu*</b>, Yuhao Zhang*, Renfei Zhou*.
        - We prove the uniqueness of a function used in the optimal algorithms for AdWords and Vertex Weighted Online Bipartite Matching and refute a previous conjecture about a well-known algorithm for AdWords.

    - title: Aggregating Quantitative Relative Judgements&#58 From Social Choice to Interpretable Ranking Prediction
      year: 2023.05 - 2023.08
      description:
        - To be submitted to <b>IJCAI 2024</b>.
        - Authors&#58 <b>Yixuan Even Xu</b>, Hanrui Zhang, Yu Cheng, Vincent Conitzer.
        - We study the quantitative judgment aggregation problem in social choice, where we propose QRJA rules and study their computational properties. We also show it empirically offers effective and interpretable contest ranking predictions.
    
    - title: Bidder Selection Problem in Position Auctions via Poisson Approximation
      year: 2022.07 - 2023.01
      description:
        - Submitted to <b>WWW 2024</b>, under review.
        - Authors&#58 Nick Gravin*, <b>Yixuan Even Xu*</b>, Renfei Zhou*.
        - We propose a novel Poisson-Chernoff relaxation of the Bidder Selection Problem for Position Auctions and give a PTAS (Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme) that is useful and efficient in practice.
