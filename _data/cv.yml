    - title: Non-Excludable Bilateral Trade Between Groups
      year: 2023.02 - 2023.05
      description:
        - Submitted to <b>NeurIPS 2023</b>, under review.
        - Coauthors&#58 Hanrui Zhang, Vincent Conitzer.
        - We generalize the traditional bilateral trade problem to a non-excludable setting, where we characterize feasible mechanisms, give a mechanism with all desiderata in some cases, and prove hardness results for others.

    - title: A One-Size-Fits-All Approach to Improving Randomness in Paper Assignment
      year: 2022.09 - 2023.05
      description:
        - Submitted to <b>NeurIPS 2023</b>, under review.
        - Coauthors&#58 Steven Jecmen, Zimeng Song, Fei Fang.
        - We identify the importance of randomness in paper assignment and formally formulate the problem, where we propose an algorithm that theoretically and empirically outperforms the currently deployed algorithm for randomized paper assignment.
