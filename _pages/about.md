I am Yixuan (Even) Xu (徐翊轩), a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [CSD](https://csd.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Professor Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/) and [Professor Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/). Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology at [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

My research interests lie in game theory and machine learning. A notable example of my research is a [conference paper-reviewer assignment algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05995) that was deployed in NeurIPS 2024. See my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/CV.pdf' | relative_url }}">CV</a>, <a href="{{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}">publications</a> and [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=viloxoAAAAAJ) for more details about the projects I have done.

Besides research, I have been actively participating in competitive programming. See my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/CV.pdf' | relative_url }}">CV</a> for selected awards in OI, ICPC and CCPC. You can also find me in [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/cz_xuyixuan), [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/cz_xuyixuan) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/progress=cz_xuyixuan).
