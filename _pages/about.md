I am Yixuan (Even) Xu (徐翊轩), a senior-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [**Yao Class**](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), directed by [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)).

My research interests lie broadly in artificial intelligence, especially topics related to economics and computation. I have worked on several projects centered around algorithmic game theory, including conference peer review, bilateral trade, and learning the coalition structure of strategic agents. See my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/CV.pdf' | relative_url }}">CV</a> and <a href="{{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}">publications</a> for more details about them.

Besides research, I have been actively participating in competitive programming. See my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/CV.pdf' | relative_url }}">CV</a> for selected awards in OI, ICPC and CCPC. You can also find me in many online competitive programming platforms like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/cz_xuyixuan), [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/cz_xuyixuan) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/progress=cz_xuyixuan).
